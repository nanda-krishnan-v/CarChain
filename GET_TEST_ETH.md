# How to Get Test ETH for Free

## Why Do You Need Test ETH?

Even on **test networks**, you still need ETH to pay for **gas fees**. Gas fees are required for:

- Deploying smart contracts
- Calling functions that modify blockchain state (like `registerCar`)
- Any transaction that writes to the blockchain

**Good news:** Test ETH is **completely free** from faucets! You just need to request it.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Check Your Current Network

1. Open MetaMask
2. Look at the network dropdown (top center)
3. Note which test network you're on:
   - **Sepolia** (Chain ID: 11155111)
   - **Holesky** (Chain ID: 17000) - formerly Hoodi
   - **Goerli** (Chain ID: 5)

### Step 2: Get Your Wallet Address

1. In MetaMask, click on your account name/address at the top
2. Click the copy icon to copy your wallet address
3. It will look like: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb`

### Step 3: Use a Faucet

Choose a faucet based on your network:

### Step 4: Wait for Confirmation

- Test ETH usually arrives within 1-10 minutes
- Check your MetaMask balance
- You should see the test ETH appear in your wallet

### Step 5: Verify You Have Enough

- **Minimum needed:** Usually 0.001 ETH is enough for several transactions
- **Typical faucet amount:** 0.1 - 0.5 ETH (plenty for testing!)
- **Gas cost per transaction:** Usually 0.0001 - 0.001 ETH

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds" Error

If you see this error in MetaMask:

1. **Check your balance:** Open MetaMask and see how much test ETH you have
2. **Get more test ETH:** Use a faucet (see above)
3. **Wait for confirmation:** Sometimes transactions take a few minutes
4. **Check network:** Make sure you're on the correct test network

### Faucet Not Working

- **Try a different faucet:** Some faucets have daily limits
- **Wait 24 hours:** Many faucets have cooldown periods
- **Complete all requirements:** Some faucets require social media verification
- **Check network:** Make sure you're requesting ETH for the correct network

### Still Having Issues?

1. **Verify network:** Make sure MetaMask shows the correct test network
2. **Check address:** Double-check you copied the correct wallet address
3. **Try multiple faucets:** Different faucets have different requirements
4. **Wait longer:** Some faucets can take up to 30 minutes

## Important Notes

- ⚠️ **Test ETH has NO real value** - it's only for testing
- ✅ **Test ETH is FREE** - you can request it anytime
- 🔄 **You can request multiple times** - if you run out, just get more
- 💰 **Gas fees are tiny** - 0.001 ETH can last for many transactions
- 🌐 **Network-specific** - ETH from Sepolia won't work on Holesky (and vice versa)
